            <h1>My Winter Break!</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            Over winter break, I flew 12 hours to get back home to Kelowna. I was able to see a couple of my best
            friends and also reconnected with my old high school friend group that I hadnâ€™t seen in a while.

                >I also spent a lot of quality time with my boyfriend and our families. Kelowna was less snowy than
                usual, but I still managed to go skiing at Big White, a popular ski mountain about an hour away. As
                usual, the trip went by quickly, and I flew back to Halifax, arriving this past Sunday morning at 2:30
                a.m! Because of the 4 hour time difference, I'm going to be exhausted for a couple weeks!</em
