    <H3>About Me</H3>
    <p>Hey! I'm Cassidy but my friends call me <em>Cass</em>. I was born in North Vancouver and moved up to 
    Kelowna when I was 5 years <u>old</u>. Kelowna is a smaller town so it's super easy to make friends
    there. Once I got to High School I met a bunch of my lifelong friends and this is also where I met
    my <strong>boyfriend</strong> of 5 years. I grew up playing soccer and volleyeball until I graduated High School in 2021.
    We both moved to Halifax for our Post Secondary Education.  </p>
