        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Hey! I'm Cassidy but my friends call me <em>Cass</em>. I was born in North Vancouver and moved up to Kelowna
            when I was 5 years <u>old</u>. Kelowna is a smaller town so it's super easy to make friends there. Once I
            got to High School I met a bunch of my lifelong friends and this is also where I met my
            <strong>boyfriend</strong> of 5 years. I grew up playing soccer and volleyeball until I graduated High
            School in 2021. We both moved to Halifax for our Post Secondary Education.
